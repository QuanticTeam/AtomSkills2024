## Before all

If you're using `nvm` (node version manager) utility in development to switch between nodejs versions, consider running `nvm use` command inside `frontend` folder. It will automatically pick the predefined version from `frontend/.nvmrc` file.

Execute `npm i` to install all neccesary project dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` to start local development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view application in the browser
- `npm run build` to build production version of the project inside `frontend/build` folder for subsequent deploying
